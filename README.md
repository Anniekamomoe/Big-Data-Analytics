# Household Electricity Consumption Analysis (UK)

## Overview
This project analyses UK household electricity consumption using data from the
**National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED)** to understand how
**property characteristics and geographic location** influence energy usage.

The work applies **statistical analysis, time series modelling, and machine learning techniques**
to solve a real-world **energy analytics challenge**.

## Objectives
- Analyse electricity consumption trends by number of bedrooms and property age
- Examine regional variations across the UK
- Apply regression and time series models to identify patterns and limitations

## Methods & Tools
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Time series analysis: ARIMA, SARIMAX
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Data visualisation: matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Findings
- Strong correlation between property characteristics and electricity consumption
- Evidence of regional disparities in energy use
- Models indicate a gradual decline in mean electricity consumption over time
- Identified multicollinearity and data limitations affecting regression stability

## Challenges & Considerations
- Limited time series observations
- High multicollinearity among predictors
- Legal, ethical, and privacy risks associated with household energy data
